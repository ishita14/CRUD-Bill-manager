# CRUD-Bill-manager

This application is a fullstack application using the tech stack MERN stack(React JS  and Node JS) and Database I used is MongoDB.
Basically we add our bill every month and store all the data in database. We can edit the bill and also can delete it!!!
there is an navbar which have 2 menus .One is to show whole tables which we entered previously and the other menu help to create/add new data.
By adding a new data it automatically reflects on the home page!!
On the home page there is an option to view the particular data ,by clicking on it we come up with more options to edit as well as delete the data.
